    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hæ! I am a computational linguist based in Reykjavík, Iceland. I'm currently employed at the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies, 
        working on Language Technology research, and working towards a PhD in Icelandic linguistics at the University of Iceland. Previously, I 
        received my MA in Language Technology from Uppsala University in Sweden and worked on LT projects at Grammatek, a private company in Iceland.
    </p>
    <p>My main research interests at the moment are language acquisition, syntactic and semantic structures in deep learning and what the 
        study of one can tell us about the other. I've also worked on several different NLP applications such as grapheme-to-phoneme transcription,
        machine translation and question answering.
    </p>
